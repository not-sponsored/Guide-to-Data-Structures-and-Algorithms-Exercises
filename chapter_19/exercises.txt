# chapter 19 - Space Complexity 


1. The function creates a new array to store approximately N^2 values, so thus,    it has a space complexity of O(N^2).

2. Because we create a new array to store about N values, the space complexity
   is O(N).

3. Function to reverse an array in O(1) space is in constant_space_reverse.py 

4. Context: Version #1 uses a new array with a for loop to store N values
            Version #2 runs a for loop and modifies the passed array in place 
            Version #3 uses recursion and calls itself N times

   Filled Table:

   Version      Time Complexity     Space Complexity

   Version #1   O(N)                O(N)
   Version #2   O(N)                O(1)
   Version #3   O(N)                O(N)
