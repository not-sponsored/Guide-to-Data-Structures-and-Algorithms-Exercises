1. Recursive function to return the number of characters in an array is located
   in count_characters_in_array.py

2. Recursive function that returns all even numbers in a new array is located
   in return_evens.py

3. Recursive function that returns the Nth number in the triangle number
   sequence (position + previous number in sequence) is located in 
   triangular_numbers.py

4. Recursive function that returns the first index of a string with x is
   located in find_x_position.py  

5. This is a well known problem called "unique paths." In unique_paths.py, a
   recursive non-memoized function returns the number of shortest paths from a 
   start position in the upper left of a grid to the finish position in the
   lower right of the grid. A faster memoized implementation is included in
   chapter_12/memoized_unique_paths.py
