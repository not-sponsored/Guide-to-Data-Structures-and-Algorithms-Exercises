# chapter 6 - Big O Best Case Worst Case 


1. The time complexity of a 3N^2 + 2N + 1 algorithm is O(N^2).

2. The time complexity of a N + log(N) algorithm is O(N). 

3. Using nested for loops to check whether a pair of numbers in an array sum to
   ten, the best case is a sum with the first two numbers or 2 steps; the
   average case is somewhere in the middle or N^2 / 2 steps; and the worst case    is a traversal of the entire array with no pairs summing to ten or N^2, which
   in order notation is O(N^2). 

4. The time complexity is O(N) because we loop through the entire array even
   if we have already found the X character we are looking for. The improved
   version for average and best case scenarios is in f
improvements in algos/findx.py
