# chapter 4 - Speeding Up With Big O 


1. Order per N elements in a data structure:
   N elements  O(N)  O(log N)  O(N^2) 
      100      100      7      10000
     2000      2000     11     4000000

2. Because the algorithm is O(N^2), we take the square root of the 256 steps to
   find the size of the array. The square root is 16 so the array is size 16.

3. The code has a nested for loop, so the time complexity is N*N or O(N^2).

4. Function with O(N) search for maximum number in linear_search_max_value.py
