# chapter 3 - O() Notation 


1. Ternary statement runs in O(1) because the input size does not affect the
   evaluation. 

2. Because we traverse an array, the function runs in O(N) because we visit
   each element once. 

3. Because we run log base 2 times for any given N, the order is O(log(N)). 

4. Because we traverse an array, the function runs in O(N) because we visit
   each element once. 

5. The median function reads and returns an exact address regardless of input
   size, so the order is O(1).
