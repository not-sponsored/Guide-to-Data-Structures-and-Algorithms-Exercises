# Completed Exercises from A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms, Second Edition

This is my take on the exercises provided in *A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms, Second Edition*.
The exercises cover a wide variety of data structures and algorithms including DFS and BFS, graphs, linked lists, heaps, dynamic programming, tries, and much more.

This book is an excellent introduction to data structures and algorithms with helpful exercises and thorough explanations. I highly recommend this book **ISBN-13: 978-1-68050-722-5**. I do not own this content. All credits go to its rightful owner.
