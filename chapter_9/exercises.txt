# chapter 9 - Stacks and Queues 


1. For a call center hold system, a queue would make sense to allow the 
   earliest callers get help first before later callers. 

2. The stack is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (top of stack is 6). If we popped two items,
   the popped items would be 6, 5.

3. The queue is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (front of queue is 1). If we dequeued two
   items, the result would be 1, 2. 

4. The function to reverse a string with a stack is located in reverse_str.py
