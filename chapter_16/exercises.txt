1. After inserting 11 into the heap it should look like the following:
                 11
       	     /        \
          10             8
        /    \         /   \
      6        9     7       4
    /   \    /   \
   2     1  3     5

2. If we delete the root node from the graph in the book (without 11), it
   should look like:  
                 9
              /     \ 
          6             8
        /   \         /   \
      3       5     7      4
    /   \
   2     1 

3. Given the following numbers 55, 22, 34, 10, 2, 99, 68 if we inserted them
   into a heap then popped them off into a new array it would be in this order
   99, 68, 55, 34, 22, 10, 2
