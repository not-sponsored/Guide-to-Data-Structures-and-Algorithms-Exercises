1. From the e-commerce store's graph, if the user views vertex "nails" the
   the edges connect "nails" to other vertices and recommends them. Here "nails"
   has edges to hammer, pins, needles, and nail polish, so these products will
   be recommended.

2. The alphabet graph should traverse in the following order assuming we visit
   the node that is earliest in the alphabet with a depth first search:
   A -> B -> E -> J -> F -> O -> C -> G -> K -> D -> H -> L -> M -> I -> N -> P

3. The alphabet graph should traverse in the following order assuming we visit
   the node that is earliest in the alphabet with a breadth first search:
   A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F -> G -> H -> I -> J -> K -> L -> M -> N -> O -> P

4. Breadth first search implemented in bfs_unweighted_shortest_path.py 

5. Unweighted shortest path implemented in bfs_unweighted_shortest_path.py
