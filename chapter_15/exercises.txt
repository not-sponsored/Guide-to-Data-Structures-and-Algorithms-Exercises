# chapter 15 - Binary Trees 


1. How a binary tree looks like after inserting [1, 5, 9, 2, 4, 10, 6, 3, 8]:
   
   1
     \
        5
     /     \
   2         9
     \     /   \
      4   6     10
     /     \ 
   3         8

2. With 1000 elements in a binary tree, search is log(N) so log(1000) is
   roughly 10. Thus at most the search should take 10 steps.

3. Function to find the greatest value in a binary tree is in
   binary_search_tree.py

4. The binary tree with book titles printed in a preorder traversal will appear
   in the following order "Moby Dick", "Great Expectations",
   "Alice in Wonderland", "Lord of the Flies", "Robinson Crusoe",
   "Pride and Prejudice", and "The Odessy".

5. The same binary tree with titles print in a postorder traversal will appear
   as "Alice in Wonderland", "Lord of the Flies", "Great Expectations",
   "Pride and Prejudice", "The Odessy", "Robinson Crusoe", and "Moby Dick".
