1. The base case from a recursive function that prints every other number is
   when low > high.

2. With a recursive factorial function, if we change the recursive call from
   n-1 to n-2 and call with factorial(10) we will cause a stack overflow
   because the base case checks if n == 1 which we will skip over because we
   subtract two from n each call, so it will call factorial(2) then factorial(0)
   skipping the base case and continuing until we get a stack overflow.
