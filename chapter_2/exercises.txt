1. A linear search for 8 out of [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13] will take 4 steps.

2. A binary search for 8 out of the above list will take 1 step because 8 is
   at the midpoint of the array.

3. Taking log base 2 of 100,000 and rounding up, it should take at most 17
   steps to perform a binary search on an array with 100,000 elements. We take
   log base 2 because with each iteration we eliminate half of the possiblee
   values.
